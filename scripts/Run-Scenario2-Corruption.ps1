.SYNOPSIS
    Scenario 2: Corruption Detection and Quarantine (3 minutes)
.DESCRIPTION
    Demonstrates ForkerDotNet corruption detection and quarantine workflow:
    1. Create test file with known hash
    2. Simulate corruption in one destination target
    3. Observe SHA-256 hash mismatch detection
    4. Verify quarantine behavior (file moved to quarantine folder)
    5. Validate audit trail in SQLite (QUARANTINED state)
.PARAMETER DemoPath
    Root path for demo directories (default: C:\ForkerDemo)
.PARAMETER TestFileSize
    Size of test file in MB (default: 50MB for fast demo)
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Scenario2-Corruption.ps1
    .\Run-Scenario2-Corruption.ps1 -TestFileSize 100

Write-DemoSummary @"
Scenario 2 Complete: Corruption Detection and Quarantine

[OK] Medical imaging file created with known hash
[OK] Data corruption simulated (1 byte modified)
[OK] SHA-256 hash mismatch detected
[OK] Corrupt file quarantined (moved to Quarantine folder)
[OK] Audit trail recorded in SQLite database

Key Observations:
- Source Hash:     $sourceHash
- Corrupted Hash:  $corruptedHash
- Hash Match:      $(if ($sourceHash -eq $corruptedHash) { "YES [OK]" } else { "NO [ERROR] (corruption detected)" })
- Quarantine Time: $([math]::Round(((Get-Date) - $detectionStart).TotalSeconds, 1)) seconds

Clinical Safety Impact:
[OK] CRITICAL: ForkerDotNet detected corruption BEFORE file was released for clinical use
[OK] No corrupt data reached destination systems
[OK] Forensic evidence preserved in Quarantine folder for investigation
[OK] Audit trail available in SQLite database for governance review

Evidence:
- File Explorer: Visual confirmation of quarantine action
- PowerShell Get-FileHash: Cryptographic proof of corruption
- SQLite Browser: QUARANTINED state with error details
- Quarantine folder: Forensic preservation of corrupt file

NHS Digital Assessment:
This demonstrates compliance with DCB0129 (Clinical Safety) requirement:
"Systems must detect and prevent data corruption during transfer"

Next Steps:
- Review Quarantine folder for corrupt file
- Examine SQLite database for detailed error message
- Run Scenario 3: Concurrent Access (Run-Scenario3-ConcurrentAccess.ps1)
