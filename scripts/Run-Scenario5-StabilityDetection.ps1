.SYNOPSIS
    Scenario 5: File Stability Detection (3 minutes)
.DESCRIPTION
    Demonstrates ForkerDotNet stability detection for growing files:
    1. Create file and start growing it (simulates slow network copy)
    2. Show ForkerDotNet detects file is still growing
    3. Observe stability detection waits for file to stop changing
    4. Verify processing only starts after file is stable
    5. Validate final hash integrity
.PARAMETER DemoPath
    Root path for demo directories (default: C:\ForkerDemo)
.PARAMETER FinalFileSizeMB
    Final size of file in MB (default: 100MB)
.PARAMETER GrowthIntervalSeconds
    Seconds between growth increments (default: 2)
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Scenario5-StabilityDetection.ps1
    .\Run-Scenario5-StabilityDetection.ps1 -FinalFileSizeMB 200 -GrowthIntervalSeconds 3

Scenario 5 Complete: File Stability Detection

[OK] File created and grown incrementally (simulated slow network copy)
[OK] ForkerDotNet detected file is growing
[OK] Stability detection waited for growth to stop
[OK] Processing only started after file was stable
[OK] Hash integrity verified after replication

Key Observations:
- Final File Size:          $([math]::Round($FinalFileSizeMB, 0)) MB
- Growth Increments:        $growthCount increments of $incrementMB MB each
- Growth Interval:          $GrowthIntervalSeconds seconds
- Total Growth Time:        $([math]::Round(($stableTime - $creationTime).TotalSeconds, 1)) seconds
- Stability Wait Time:      $([math]::Round($stabilityWaitTime, 1)) seconds
- Copy Duration:            $([math]::Round($copyDuration, 1)) seconds
- Total Duration:           $([math]::Round($totalDuration, 1)) seconds
- Data Integrity:           [OK] All hashes match (no corruption)

Clinical Workflow Impact:
[OK] Large medical imaging files often arrive via slow network copy
[OK] Scanning devices may write files incrementally
[OK] ForkerDotNet waits for complete file before processing
[OK] No incomplete files copied to destinations
[OK] No "file changed during copy" errors

Technical Implementation:
- File size monitored at regular intervals (StabilityCheckIntervalSeconds)
- Processing starts after N consecutive checks show no growth (StabilityConsecutiveChecks)
- Prevents copying of incomplete/corrupted partial files
- Invariant I1 enforced: "Files only processed when stable"

Evidence:
- File Explorer: Visual confirmation of delayed processing
- PowerShell Get-FileHash: Data integrity maintained
- DataGrip: State transitions show stability wait
- Timestamps: Stability detection timing measured

NHS Digital Assessment:
This demonstrates compliance with data integrity requirements:
"Systems must not process incomplete or actively-changing files"

Configuration Tuning:
If stability detection is too slow or too fast, adjust:
- StabilityCheckIntervalSeconds (default: 5-10 seconds)
- StabilityConsecutiveChecks (default: 2-3 checks)
- MinimumFileSizeBytes (ignore tiny transient files)

Next Steps:
- Review DataGrip database queries for stability detection audit trail
- Test with real DICOM/SVS scanner output
- Adjust stability configuration based on network characteristics
- Export evidence package for governance review
