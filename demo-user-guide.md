## Demonstration Scenarios

### Scenario Details

#### 1. Live Clinical Workflow (End-to-End)

**What It Shows**:
- Pathology scanner creates large SVS file progressively
- ForkerDotNet detects file but waits for stability
- Once stable, file copied to Clinical + Research targets simultaneously
- SHA-256 hash verification on all three files
- Success confirmation with audit trail

**Clinical Safety Validation**:
- ✅ Incomplete files NOT processed (file stability detection)
- ✅ Atomic operations (no partial files visible)
- ✅ Dual-target replication (Clinical + Research)
- ✅ Cryptographic verification (SHA-256 hash match)
- ✅ Complete audit trail (all state transitions logged)

**Expected Results**:
```
✓ Pathology Scanner Integration: PASS
✓ File Stability Detection: PASS
✓ Atomic Copy Operations: PASS
✓ Dual-Target Replication: PASS
✓ Cryptographic Verification: PASS
✓ Data Integrity: PASS
```

---

#### 2. Destination Locking Resilience

**What It Shows**:
- ForkerDotNet processing files to Clinical destination
- External monitoring system simultaneously accessing files
- Processing continues without stalls or errors
- No corruption from concurrent access

**Clinical Safety Validation**:
- ✅ External systems can read destination files during processing
- ✅ No file locking prevents access
- ✅ No corruption from concurrent operations
- ✅ System responsiveness maintained

**Expected Results**:
```
✓ External system accessing files: HANDLED
✓ File processing during external access: CONTINUED
✓ Data integrity during concurrent access: MAINTAINED
✓ System responsiveness: MAINTAINED
```

**Clinical Impact**: NPIC ingestion can access files immediately after copy completes

---

#### 3. File Stability Detection

**What It Shows**:
- Pathology scanner starts writing large file
- ForkerDotNet detects file but marks as "growing"
- System performs multiple stability checks
- Processing only begins after file stops growing

**Clinical Safety Validation**:
- ✅ Growing files NOT processed
- ✅ Size change detection works correctly
- ✅ Minimum age requirement enforced
- ✅ Complete data integrity ensured

**Expected Results**:
```
File actively being written:      ⚠ WAITING (prevents incomplete processing)
File size changing during checks: ⚠ WAITING (ensures data integrity)
File stable for required duration: ✓ PROCESSING (safe to copy)
Minimum age requirement:          ✓ ENFORCED (additional safety margin)
```

**Clinical Impact**: Zero risk of processing incomplete pathology scans

---

#### 4. Data Corruption Prevention

**What It Shows**:
- Creates reference medical imaging file with known SHA-256 hash
- Performs normal copy (hash verification passes)
- Simulates 3 corruption scenarios:
  1. **Modified patient data** - Changes patient ID in file
  2. **Truncated file** - Removes last 1KB of data
  3. **Single bit corruption** - Flips one bit (cosmic ray simulation)
- All corruptions detected by SHA-256 verification
- Corrupted files automatically quarantined

**Clinical Safety Validation**:
- ✅ Content modification detected (patient data corruption)
- ✅ File truncation detected (incomplete transfer)
- ✅ Single bit corruption detected (storage/transmission errors)
- ✅ Quarantine system isolates corrupt files
- ✅ Corrupt data never reaches clinical systems

**Expected Results**:
```
Normal file copy:           ✓ VERIFIED (hash matches)
Modified patient data:      ✓ DETECTED (quarantined)
Truncated medical file:     ✓ DETECTED (quarantined)
Single bit corruption:      ✓ DETECTED (quarantined)
Quarantine mechanism:       ✓ VERIFIED (isolated from clinical data)
```

**Clinical Impact**: Near-zero risk of data corruption in clinical pathway

---

#### 5. Failure Mode Recovery

**What It Shows**:
- Normal baseline operation established
- Service restart scenario (temp files cleaned, processing resumed)
- Network interruption (automatic retry with backoff)
- Partial file cleanup (interrupted operations cleaned)
- Backlog processing (all pending files processed)

**Clinical Safety Validation**:
- ✅ Automatic restart with temp file cleanup
- ✅ Retry mechanisms for network/storage issues
- ✅ Partial file cleanup prevents corruption
- ✅ Backlog processing ensures no files lost
- ✅ Data integrity maintained through all failure modes

**Expected Results**:
```
Service restart during processing:   ✓ RECOVERED (temp files cleaned)
Network/storage interruption:        ✓ RECOVERED (retry succeeded)
Partial file cleanup:                ✓ RECOVERED (incomplete files removed)
Backlog processing:                  ✓ RECOVERED (all pending files processed)
Data integrity after recovery:       ✓ MAINTAINED (no corruption)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Cannot show selection prompt since the current terminal isn't interactive"

**Cause**: Running interactive demo in non-interactive environment (CI/CD, automation)

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use non-interactive test mode
cd tests/Forker.Clinical.Demo
dotnet run --test
```

---

#### Issue: Demo colors/formatting not displaying correctly

**Cause**: Terminal doesn't support ANSI/VT100 escape codes

**Solution**:
- Use Windows Terminal (recommended)
- Use PowerShell 7+ instead of CMD
- Use VS Code integrated terminal
- Enable ANSI color support in your terminal settings

---

#### Issue: Dashboard not loading at http://localhost:5000

**Cause**: Port 5000 already in use

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check what's using port 5000
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Kill the process or use different port
cd demo/src/Demo.Dashboard
dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:5001"
```

---

#### Issue: "File access denied" during demo

**Cause**: Antivirus or file system permissions

**Solution**:
- Add demo directories to antivirus exclusions (C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Temp\ForkerDemo*)
- Run terminal as administrator (not recommended, but may help)
- Check file system permissions on temp directory

---

#### Issue: Large file creation is slow

**Cause**: Slow disk I/O on temp directory

**Solution**:
- Demos use temp directory by default (fast)
- If temp is on slow disk, modify demo to use different location
- Reduce simulated file sizes in demo code (not recommended for realistic validation)

---
