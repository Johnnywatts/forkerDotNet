# End of Day Summary - 2025-10-08

## Session Overview

**Focus:** ForkerDotNet Console - Architectural Redesign (API-First Approach)

**Key Achievement:** Discovered and resolved SQLite WAL cross-platform compatibility issues by redesigning console to use HTTP API instead of direct database access.

---

## Major Work Completed

### 1. SQLite WAL Compatibility Investigation

**Problem Discovered:**
- Console (Linux Docker container) attempting to read SQLite database with WAL mode
- Windows ForkerDotNet service writes to database with WAL journaling
- Cross-platform WAL file access fails across Windows/Linux boundary

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. `mode=ro&immutable=1` - Works but shows stale data (snapshot at container start)
2. `mode=ro` without immutable - Disk I/O errors (4618)
3. `mode=ro&cache=shared` - Still WAL locking issues
4. `mode=ro&nolock=1` - WAL locking problems persist

**Root Cause:**
- SQLite WAL files (.db-wal, .db-shm) require OS-level file locking
- Docker volume mounts from Windows NTFS to Linux container don't support WAL shared memory properly
- modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go driver) has limitations with cross-platform WAL access

**Resolution:**
- Abandon direct SQLite access from console
- Implement HTTP API in ForkerDotNet for database queries
- Console uses direct filesystem access for folder views (no DB needed)

---

### 2. UI Design Refinement (Mockup Review)

User provided **Mockup1.jpg** showing desired console layout:

**Two View Modes:**

**A) Folder View (4 Explorer-Style Panes):**
- **Input** - Files waiting/being copied (sorted by descending age)
- **Dest A** - Verified copies at destination A
- **Dest B** - Verified copies at destination B
- **Failed** - Permanent copy failures after retries

Each pane shows: filename, size, age/modified time
Title bar shows count: "Input (5 files, 11.2 GB)"

**B) Transaction View (2 State-Based Panes):**
- **In Progress** - Discovered/Queued/InProgress/Partial states
- **Completed** - Verified/Failed/Quarantined terminal states

**Additional Features:**
- **Service Health Panel** - PID, uptime, memory, DB path, last activity
- **Stats Bar** - Total, Active, Verified, Failed, Quarantined counts
- **Re-queue Button** - Move files from Failed → Input (production operation, not demo-only)

**Key Clarifications:**
- Folder views show **actual file listings** (like Windows Explorer), not just counts
- Files in Input stay there during copy (no Processing folder needed)
- Failed folder for copy/IO failures (after 3 retries)
- Quarantine folder for hash mismatches (verification failures)
- Archive folder for successful copies (48-hour retention, cleanup not yet implemented)
- Reservoir folder for demo mode file drops
- NPIC folder for simulated downstream processing (demo mode)

---

### 3. Architecture Redesign

**New Architecture: API-First Approach**

**ForkerDotNet Service:**
- Add **MonitoringService** (HTTP listener on port 8081)
- Bind to `0.0.0.0:8081` to accept Docker connections
- CORS enabled for `localhost:5000`
- 5 API endpoints:
  1. `GET /api/monitoring/health` → PID, uptime, memory, DB path
  2. `GET /api/monitoring/stats` → Job counts by state
  3. `GET /api/monitoring/jobs?state={state}&limit={n}` → Filtered job list
  4. `GET /api/monitoring/jobs/{jobId}` → Job details with targets
  5. `POST /api/monitoring/requeue` → Move Failed → Input, reset job state

**Console (Docker Container):**
- **HTTP Client** - Calls ForkerDotNet API via `host.docker.internal:8081`
- **Filesystem Scanner** - Direct reads of `/data/Input`, `/data/DestinationA`, etc.
- **No SQLite Access** - Eliminated entirely

**Docker Networking:**
- Use `extra_hosts: host.docker.internal:host-gateway`
- Works on both Windows Docker Desktop AND WSL Docker (requires Docker 20.10+)
- Universal solution for cross-platform development

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No SQLite WAL locking issues
- ✅ Separation of concerns (DB is ForkerDotNet's internal detail)
- ✅ Console has read-only filesystem access (security)
- ✅ All write operations go through API (audit trail)
- ✅ Works reliably on Windows + WSL

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Console Deployment: Docker (Not Native .exe)
- **Decision:** Keep console Dockerized for security (zero-CVE requirement)
- **Rationale:** NHS-grade security requirements, isolation, vulnerability scanning
- **Network:** Use `host.docker.internal:host-gateway` for API access

### 2. Folder Views: Direct Filesystem (Not Database Queries)
- **Decision:** Console reads filesystem directly for folder listings
- **Rationale:** No database queries needed, simpler, faster, no WAL issues
- **Implementation:** Mount `C:\ForkerDemo:/data:ro` (read-only)

### 3. Re-queue Operation: Production Feature (Not Demo-Only)
- **Decision:** Allow re-queuing failed files in production mode
- **Implementation:** HTTP POST endpoint, ForkerDotNet moves files (console has no write access)
- **Security:** Console read-only, all file operations audited through API

### 4. API Port: 8081 (Separate from Health)
- **Decision:** Use port 8081 for MonitoringService, keep 8080 for HealthService
- **Rationale:** Separation of concerns, health checks independent from monitoring

### 5. Failed vs Quarantine Folders
- **Failed:** Copy/IO failures after retries → `Failed` folder
- **Quarantine:** Hash mismatch (corruption) → `Quarantine` folder
- **Clarification:** Two distinct error categories with different handling

---

## Conversations & Clarifications

### Docker Deployment Discussion
- **User Question:** "re 'Run console as native Windows .exe (not Docker) for simplicity', this is dockerised principally for security vulnerability issues so would like to leave like this."
- **Resolution:** Keep Docker deployment, use `host.docker.internal` for API access
- **Cross-platform solution:** `extra_hosts: host-gateway` works on Windows + WSL

### Folder Structure Clarification
- **User:** "I don't think files need to move out of input into processing"
- **Resolution:** Files stay in Input during copy, no Processing folder movement
- **Success path:** Input → (copy) → both destinations verified → move to Archive
- **Failure paths:**
  - Copy fails → retry 3 times → move to Failed
  - Hash mismatch → move to Quarantine

### Folder View Requirements
- **User:** "these folder views are like explorer windows, they list the files in those files"
- **Clarification:** Not just counts - actual file listings with name, size, age
- **Sorting:** Descending by age (newest files at top)
- **Update rate:** 2 seconds (configurable)

### API Design Question
- **User:** "my preference is that the database is part of the forker service, if you want to know something about that service use an API"
- **Response:** Architecturally correct - HTTP API is the right approach
- **Performance:** Not an issue for monitoring console (simple queries, millisecond response times)

## Key Learnings

### 1. SQLite WAL + Docker Volume Mounts
- **Learning:** WAL mode doesn't work reliably across Windows/Linux Docker volume mounts
- **Cause:** OS-level file locking differences, shared memory incompatibility
- **Solution:** Use HTTP API to abstract database access

### 2. Immutable vs Live Data
- **immutable=1:** Creates snapshot, no WAL issues, but shows stale data
- **mode=ro:** Attempts live reads, but WAL files cause I/O errors
- **Resolution:** Live data requires same-OS access OR API abstraction

### 3. Docker host.docker.internal Cross-Platform
- **Discovery:** `extra_hosts: host-gateway` works on both Windows and Linux Docker
- **Requirement:** Docker 20.10+
- **Benefit:** Single docker-compose.yml works everywhere

### 4. Separation of Concerns
- **Database:** ForkerDotNet's internal implementation detail
- **API Contract:** Stable interface for monitoring
- **Filesystem:** Direct access for simple folder views
- **Security:** Console read-only, all writes through audited API
