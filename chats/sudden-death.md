fbcdd29 - Demo bug fix + fake demo discovery
9175ab5 - Task management cleanup + real demo plan
TASK_LIST.md is now:
Clean and consistent formatting
All 14 phases visible with status
Phase 11.1 marked as üîÑ IN PROGRESS (URGENT)
42 discrete tasks for real demo system
Next Steps (from TASK_LIST.md):
Create PowerShell demo orchestration scripts (7 scenarios)
Build WPF Resilience Test Controller (optional)
Update demo-user-guide.md with Windows tools approach
Delete or deprecate fake Spectre.Console demos
Test all scenarios with real ForkerDotNet service
The task list is now properly maintained with git hygiene, no completed task clutter, and clear next actions!
My understanding is that a critical element of this utility's resiliance, observability and integration into any opperations management tools is that this should run as a service. are we doing this at the moment? should we get his working before we built are much improved demo suite?
Excellent question! Let me investigate the current state of Windows Service deployment.

Analysis: Windows Service Deployment Status
Current State ‚ùå NOT RUNNING AS WINDOWS SERVICE
What We Have:
‚úÖ Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Worker project type (correct foundation)
‚úÖ BackgroundService implementation (Worker.cs - but just a placeholder heartbeat)
‚úÖ Host.CreateApplicationBuilder (correct hosting pattern)
‚ùå NO Windows Service integration - Missing UseWindowsService() call
‚ùå NO service package reference - Missing Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices
‚ùå Worker.cs is a skeleton - Doesn't actually run ForkerDotNet processing
Critical Gap:
// Program.cs line 24 - Currently:
await host.RunAsync();

// Should be:
await host.RunAsync(); // Works in console mode AND as Windows Service
But it needs the package + UseWindowsService() to actually work as a Windows Service.
Why This Matters - You're Absolutely Right
Your key insight is correct: Windows Service deployment is critical for:
‚úÖ Resilience
Automatic restart on crash (Windows Service Recovery)
Automatic startup after system reboot
Runs without user logged in
‚úÖ Observability
Windows Event Log integration
Service Control Manager monitoring
Integration with operations management tools (SCOM, System Center, etc.)
‚úÖ Operations Management
Can be monitored/controlled remotely via WMI
PowerShell service cmdlets (Get-Service, Restart-Service, etc.)
Integration with monitoring tools (Nagios, Zabbix, PRTG, etc.)
‚úÖ Security
Runs under dedicated service account (gMSA recommended)
Least-privilege permissions
No interactive logon required
‚úÖ Production Requirements
NHS/clinical environments require services, not console apps
Cannot rely on user session staying active
Must survive system updates/reboots
Current Demonstrations Are Flawed
Problem: All current demos (fake or real) assume ForkerDotNet runs as:
Console application (dotnet run)
Developer-launched process
Dependent on terminal session
This doesn't match production reality where it will run as:
Windows Service
No console window
Started by Service Control Manager
Runs in Session 0 (non-interactive)
Priority Question: Should We Fix Service Deployment First?
YES - Here's why:
Option A: Fix Windows Service First (RECOMMENDED)
Pros:
Demos will show actual production deployment
Can demonstrate service restart, automatic recovery, monitoring
Integration with real operations management tools
Evidence package shows Windows Service Control Manager
More credible for governance approval
Cons:
Takes 2-4 hours to implement properly
May discover integration issues early
Risk if we don't: Demos show console app, but production uses service - deployment mismatch discovered late
Option B: Build Demos First, Service Later
Pros:
Can start demos immediately
Might be faster to governance presentation
Cons:
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RISK: Demos won't match production deployment
May discover service integration issues after demos complete
Have to redo demos if service deployment changes behavior
Governance might ask "how does it run in production?" - answer is "we haven't built that yet"
What's Involved in Windows Service Implementation
Minimal (2-3 hours):
Add Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices package
Add UseWindowsService() to Program.cs
Wire up actual ForkerDotNet services in Worker.cs (currently just placeholder)
Test deployment with sc.exe create or NSSM
Validate automatic restart on crash
Document deployment procedure
Comprehensive (1 day):
Above + Event Log integration
Above + Service configuration (recovery actions, delayed start, etc.)
Above + gMSA service account setup documentation
Above + PowerShell deployment scripts
Above + Integration with Windows Event Log for monitoring
My Recommendation
Plan Mode
‚éø
Stayed in plan mode
re your point "Governance might ask "how does it run in production?" - answer is "we haven't built that yet"" We wil lbe able to deploy this  onto a test server build the same as production to validate and then there will be a further test phase on procution before go live. I cant deploy to the test server until its buiuld locally on his windows 11 machine and all the tests and demos work flawlessly
You're absolutely right - I misunderstood your deployment workflow. Let me revise the plan:
Revised Understanding of Your Deployment Pipeline
Developer Machine (Windows 11)
    ‚Üì Build + Test + Demo (console app is fine here)
Test Server (Windows Server - production-like)
    ‚Üì Deploy as Windows Service + Validate
Production Test Phase
    ‚Üì Limited production usage
Full Production Go-Live
Corrected Priority Assessment
You're right: We need to get everything working locally on Windows 11 first, then worry about Windows Service deployment when we're ready to deploy to the test server. Current priority should be:
‚úÖ Fix the fake demos ‚Üí Real observable demos (Phase 11.1)
‚úÖ Make sure ForkerDotNet actually works end-to-end locally
‚úÖ All tests pass
‚úÖ Demos show real file operations
THEN ‚Üí Deploy to test server as Windows Service (Phase 13)
The Real Question: Does ForkerDotNet Actually Work?
Looking at Worker.cs, it's just a placeholder heartbeat:
protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
{
    _logger.LogInformation("Forker Worker Service started - Phase 1 skeleton");
    while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        _logger.LogDebug("Worker heartbeat at: {Time}", DateTimeOffset.Now);
        await Task.Delay(30000, stoppingToken); // Heartbeat every 30 seconds
    }
}
This doesn't run any actual ForkerDotNet processing! It should be doing:
Starting IFileDiscoveryService to watch Input directory
Processing discovered files with ICopyOrchestrator
Running verification with IVerificationOrchestrator
Cleaning up Input directory after successful copy+verify
Critical Question for You
Before we build demos, do we need to wire up the actual ForkerDotNet processing pipeline in Worker.cs? Currently we have:
‚úÖ All the services implemented (IFileCopyService, IHashingService, ICopyOrchestrator, etc.)
‚úÖ 287+ tests passing
‚ùå But Worker.cs doesn't actually USE them - it's just a heartbeat
For real observable demos using File Explorer + Process Monitor + SQLite Browser, we need:
ForkerDotNet to actually watch the Input directory
ForkerDotNet to actually copy files when they appear
ForkerDotNet to actually update SQLite database
ForkerDotNet to actually clean up Input after verification
Proposed Corrected Plan
Phase 11.0 - Wire Up Actual Processing (NEW - URGENT)
Estimated Time: 4-8 hours Tasks:
Wire up IFileDiscoveryService in Worker.cs (start file watching)
Wire up ICopyOrchestrator for file processing
Wire up IVerificationOrchestrator for hash verification
Wire up Input directory cleanup after verification
Add proper error handling and logging
Test end-to-end: Drop file in Input ‚Üí appears in Clinical + Research ‚Üí disappears from Input
Verify SQLite database shows job progression (DISCOVERED ‚Üí QUEUED ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí VERIFIED)
This is the foundation for real demos - without this, we can't show File Explorer with actual files moving, or SQLite Browser with real state transitions.
Phase 11.1 - Real Demo System (AFTER 11.0)
Estimated Time: 2-3 days Build PowerShell scripts + WPF controller that demonstrate actual ForkerDotNet running locally:
Run dotnet run --project src/Forker.Service (console mode is fine for local demos)
Drop files in Input directory
Watch them move to Clinical + Research
Verify hashes with PowerShell
Check SQLite state with SQLite Browser
Phase 13 - Windows Service Deployment (AFTER demos work locally)
Estimated Time: 1 day When ready to deploy to test server:
Add Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices package
Add UseWindowsService() to Program.cs
Create deployment scripts (Install-ForkerService.ps1)
Deploy to Windows Server test environment
Validate as Windows Service
Test automatic restart, logging, monitoring
Key Question for You
What is the current state of Worker.cs integration? Is ForkerDotNet actually processing files end-to-end right now, or is Worker.cs still just the Phase 1 skeleton heartbeat? If it's still just the skeleton, then Phase 11.0 (Wire Up Actual Processing) should be the next priority before building any demos. Would you like me to:
Check if Worker.cs has actual processing (look at git history, check what's wired up)
Create Phase 11.0 task list (wire up actual processing if needed)
Then proceed with Phase 11.1 (real demos showing actual processing)
Let me know and I'll adjust the plan accordingly!
re "Developer Machine (Windows 11)
    ‚Üì Build + Test + Demo (console app is fine here)", NO, console app is not fine, we need to test the full build locally UNLESS its not possible because of the OS i'm on.
You're absolutely right - I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let me reconsider:
Key Question: Can Windows Service Run on Windows 11?
YES - Windows Services work identically on:
Windows 11 (your dev machine)
Windows Server 2019/2022 (test/production servers)
There's no technical reason to defer Windows Service implementation. You can build, test, and run as a Windows Service on your Windows 11 machine right now.
Your Correct Position
"We need to test the full build locally" means:
ForkerDotNet running as Windows Service on Windows 11
Controlled via Services.msc on Windows 11
Automatic restart configured on Windows 11
Testing with actual service crashes/recovery on Windows 11
Then deploy identical build to test server
This is the right approach because:
‚úÖ Tests the actual production deployment method locally
‚úÖ Discovers service integration issues early on your machine
‚úÖ Demos show real Windows Service (not console app pretending)
‚úÖ No surprises when deploying to test server
‚úÖ Governance sees actual production configuration
So My Original Assessment Was Correct
Windows Service implementation should come BEFORE building demos because:
You need to test the full production build locally (your requirement)
Windows Service works fine on Windows 11 (technical reality)
Demos should show Windows Service, not console app (credibility)
Revised Critical Path
MUST DO FIRST: Determine Current State
Before we plan anything, we need to answer: Question 1: Does Worker.cs actually run ForkerDotNet processing, or is it still the Phase 1 skeleton heartbeat? Question 2: Can you currently drop a file in Input directory and see it copied to Clinical + Research when you run dotnet run --project src/Forker.Service? If the answer to Question 2 is NO, then we have a bigger problem than Windows Service deployment - the core pipeline isn't wired up yet.
Proposed Investigation
Let me:
Check Worker.cs to see if actual processing is wired up
Check Program.cs to see if all services are registered
Check git history to see if processing pipeline was integrated
Determine if we need Phase 11.0 (Wire Up Processing) before Phase 11.2 (Windows Service)
Then I'll present a complete plan based on what's actually implemented. Shall I investigate the current state of Worker.cs and service integration?
OK! please investigate.
