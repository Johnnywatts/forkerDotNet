# End of Day Session - October 15, 2025

**Session Duration:** ~4 hours
**Focus:** Console Phase 3 completion + Demo Mode design
**Status:** Phase 3 complete ✅, Demo Mode design complete ✅

---

## Summary of Achievements

### 1. Console Phase 3 Completion (State History Display)

**Problem Identified:** State history API was returning data but UI wasn't displaying it correctly

**Root Causes Found:**
1. Missing `/api/jobs/{id}/state-history` route handler in Go Console router
2. API field name mismatch: API returns `copyState` but UI looked for `state`
3. Filter persistence issues (reverted to "Today" on refresh)
4. Auto-refresh interrupting scrolling

**Fixes Implemented:**
- Added `handleJobStateHistoryAPI` function in [handlers_api.go](../src/Forker.Console/internal/server/handlers_api.go)
- Added route detection for `/state-history` suffix in [router_api.go](../src/Forker.Console/internal/server/router_api.go)
- Fixed field name: `target.copyState || target.state || 'Unknown'`
- Implemented filter persistence with localStorage
- Added scroll detection to pause auto-refresh during user interaction
- Updated [appsettings.Demo.json](../src/Forker.Service/appsettings.Demo.json) with StateChangeLogging config

**Results:**
- State history now displays correctly in Complete pane
- Full timeline with timestamps and durations visible
- Target states show "TargetA: ✓ Verified" correctly (not "undefined")
- Filter persists across page refreshes
- Scroll interruption resolved

**Commit Created:** `f4a3ccb` - "feat: Complete Console Phase 3 with state history display (Task 3.8)"

**Test Results:**
- 281/281 tests passing (Domain: 143, Infrastructure: 116, Resilience: 22)
- Console accessible at http://localhost:8082
- State history API responding correctly
- Tested with 6x 2-3GB medical imaging files

### 2. Concurrency Model Investigation

**User Question:** "I'm dropping in 6 files that are 2g each, does the forker service grab them all and start working on them all immediately? is this inherently multithreaded?"

**Answer Discovered:**
- **YES, inherently multithreaded** - Each file discovery fires async void handler
- **Concurrency control via semaphores** - `MaxConcurrentCopiesPerTarget: 2` (from config)
- **Max 4 concurrent operations** - 2 per target × 2 targets = 4 simultaneous files

**Evidence from Logs:**
```
14:58:49 - File 1 starts copying (2.3GB)
14:58:53 - File 1 still copying, File 2 starts (2.4GB)
14:58:57 - Files 1 & 2 still copying, File 3 starts (3.1GB)
14:59:03 - Files 2 & 3 still copying, File 4 WAITS (semaphore limit reached)
14:59:09 - File 2 finishes (15.5s), File 4 starts
```

**Key Findings:**
- Files process concurrently but controlled (not unlimited)
- Semaphore per target prevents disk I/O contention
- Queuing happens when all semaphore slots busy
- Small files (50MB) process in 120ms - too fast to see Discovered/Queued states
- Large files (2-3GB) take 3-4s to copy, 1-2s to verify per target

---

### 3. Demo Mode Design (Major Planning Session)

**Context:** User needs bulletproof demo system for Chief Clinical Safety Officer (CCSO) presentation

**Key Requirements Clarified:**
1. **Reservoir Concept** - Stage files separately, then simulate scanner arrival with batch OS copies
2. **External Polling** - Simulate PACS/Sectra system continuously reading from DestinationA
3. **Real 2-3GB Files** - Must handle realistic medical imaging file sizes
4. **Corruption Safety** - Triple-locked (Demo mode + config flag + explicit confirmation)
5. **Zero Risk Tolerance** - Demo must be bulletproof - "if I fail demoing this to a CCSO it's game over"
6. **Console-Driven** - All initiated from Console UI, no manual PowerShell execution
7. **Evidence Export** - To user-defined location for governance review
8. **Auto-Cleanup** - Automated reset between scenarios

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Don't reimplement** - Orchestrate existing mature PowerShell scripts
- **No fakes** - Real files, real service, real database, real production code
- **Single source of truth** - Console UI orchestrates everything
- **Dual purpose** - PowerShell scripts work standalone OR via Console (integration tests!)

**5 Scenarios Identified:**
1. **End-to-End** - Complete workflow (5 min)
2. **Corruption Detection** - Hash mismatch → Quarantine (4 min)
3. **Concurrent Access** - Non-locking file operations (5 min)
4. **Crash Recovery** - Service kill → Auto-recovery (5 min)
5. **Stability Detection** - Growing files detection (4 min)

**46 Failure Modes Identified:**
- File System Failures: 11 scenarios
- Service State Failures: 9 scenarios
- Database Failures: 7 scenarios
- State Machine Failures: 8 scenarios
- Hash Verification Failures: 5 scenarios
- Timing & Concurrency: 6 scenarios

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Prevention (80%):** Pre-flight checks catch most issues before execution
- **Detection (15%):** Timeout monitoring, health polling, error parsing
- **Recovery (5%):** Graceful error messages, auto-cleanup, clear remediation

**Documents Created:**
1. [demo-console-enhancements-design.md](../demo-console-enhancements-design.md) - Complete 6000+ word design document
2. [demo-console-enhancements-task-list.md](../demo-console-enhancements-task-list.md) - Detailed task breakdown

**Estimated Effort:** 10-12 hours
- Phase 1: Proof of Concept (4 hours) - Pre-flight + Scenario 1
- Phase 2: Critical Features (4 hours) - All scenarios + external poller
- Phase 3: Evidence & Cleanup (3 hours) - Export + reset automation
- Phase 4: Polish & Practice (2 hours) - UI polish + CCSO rehearsal

## Architecture Decisions

### Console Demo Mode Architecture

**Three-Layer Safety Model:**

```
Layer 1: Pre-Flight Validation (13 checks)
├─ Service health endpoint responding
├─ Database exists and writable
├─ All directories exist and writable (Input, DestA, DestB, Quarantine, Reservoir)
├─ Disk space >20GB per destination
├─ Environment == Demo
├─ StateChangeLogging enabled
└─ No active jobs

Layer 2: Scenario Orchestration
├─ Lock scenarios (mutex - only 1 active)
├─ Execute PowerShell scripts via exec.Command
├─ Parse stdout/stderr in real-time
├─ Stream progress via SSE to UI
├─ Monitor service health continuously
└─ Handle timeouts at each step

Layer 3: Failure Recovery
├─ Detect failure type (transient vs permanent)
├─ Retry transient failures (3 attempts)
├─ Escalate permanent failures to user
├─ Offer cleanup/reset options
└─ Log all failures for post-mortem
```

**Key Components:**

1. **Pre-Flight Validation System**
   - 13 critical checks before allowing scenario execution
   - Blocks on critical failures, warns on non-critical
   - API: `GET /api/demo/preflight`

2. **Scenario Orchestration Engine**
   - Executes PowerShell scripts from Console UI
   - Parses output for progress indication (STEP, [OK], [ERROR], %)
   - Streams via SSE to UI for real-time updates
   - API: `POST /api/demo/run-scenario` (SSE stream)

3. **External Poller (Sectra Import Simulation)**
   - Continuously reads files from DestinationA (every 5s)
   - Proves non-locking behavior
   - Alerts if any file locked (CRITICAL FAILURE)
   - API: `POST /api/demo/poller/start`, `POST /api/demo/poller/stop`, `GET /api/demo/poller/stats`

4. **Real-Time State Monitoring**
   - Already 90% complete from Phase 3!
   - Just need to accelerate refresh to 500ms during demos
   - Highlight current demo job visually

5. **Evidence Collection System**
   - Exports: DB snapshot, logs, state history JSON, README, governance checklist
   - User-defined output path
   - API: `POST /api/demo/export-evidence`

6. **Cleanup & Reset System**
   - Waits for jobs to complete (2min timeout)
   - Cleans Input, Reservoir, Quarantine
   - Optionally cleans Destinations
   - API: `POST /api/demo/cleanup`

## Technical Insights

### 1. Concurrency Model (ForkerDotNet Service)

**Discovery:** Each file discovery fires `async void OnFileDiscovered` handler (independent async operations)

**Semaphore Control:**
```csharp
// Per-target semaphores (MaxConcurrentCopiesPerTarget: 2)
var semaphore = _targetSemaphores[target.Id];
await semaphore.WaitAsync(cancellationToken); // BLOCKS if limit reached
```

**Result:**
- Max 2 concurrent copies to TargetA + 2 to TargetB = 4 total concurrent operations
- Files 1-3 start immediately (slots available)
- File 4 waits until File 2 completes (~6s wait)
- Prevents disk I/O contention while maximizing throughput

### 2. State Transition Timing

**Small Files (50MB):**
- Discovered → Queued: <50ms (too fast to see!)
- Queued → InProgress: <50ms
- Copy: 120ms per target
- Verify: 1-2ms per target
- **Total: ~250ms** (faster than 2s Console refresh!)

**Large Files (2.3GB):**
- Discovered → Queued: 200-500ms (stability detection)
- Queued → InProgress: <50ms
- Copy: 3.96s per target (1GB/min throughput)
- Verify: 1.5s per target (SHA-256)
- **Total: ~8-10s** (visible in Console)

**Why User Doesn't See Early States:**
- 2-second auto-refresh is too slow for 250ms transitions
- Large files process faster than expected on user's hardware
- Demo Mode solution: Accelerate refresh to 500ms

### 3. PowerShell Output Parsing Strategy

**Pattern Detection:**
```go
// Step progression
if strings.HasPrefix(line, "STEP ") {
    // "STEP 3: Copying file to destinations"
    extractStepNumber() -> 3
    extractMessage() -> "Copying file to destinations"
}

// Status updates
if strings.Contains(line, "[OK]") {
    status = "success"
    extractMessage() -> "File created (2.3GB)"
}

// Progress indicators
if strings.Contains(line, "%") {
    // "Target A: 45% | Target B: 52%"
    extractProgressMessage()
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reuse 400+ lines of proven PowerShell per scenario
- No reimplementation = zero risk
- PowerShell scripts work standalone OR via Console

### 4. Corruption Safety (Triple-Locked)

**Layer 1:** Environment variable check
```powershell
if ($env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT -ne "Demo") {
    throw "Corruption injection only allowed in Demo mode"
}
```

**Layer 2:** Configuration flag
```json
"Testing": {
    "AllowCorruptionInjection": true  // Must be explicit
}
```

**Layer 3:** Explicit confirmation
```powershell
if (-not $ExplicitConfirmation) {
    throw "Must include confirmation"
}
```

**Result:** Impossible to accidentally corrupt production files

---

## Questions Answered

### Q1: Are files picked up too early (not intact)?
**A:** No - Stability detection checks file size unchanged for 2-3 consecutive checks (5-10s intervals). Scenario 5 specifically demonstrates this.

### Q2: How to demonstrate external polling (PACS/Sectra)?
**A:** Build async poller that reads from DestinationA every 5s, start/stop via button, show statistics. Proves non-locking.

### Q3: File sizes for real demos?
**A:** 2-3GB medical imaging files (realistic clinical sizes). Timing: 3-4s copy + 1-2s verify per target = 8-12s total.

### Q4: How to safely inject corruption for demo?
**A:** Triple-locked in PowerShell (environment + config + explicit confirmation). XOR single byte at midpoint. Only in DestinationA (DestinationB clean for comparison).

### Q5: Should DataGrip be part of demo?
**A:** No - Console Transactions view now sufficient with state history display.

### Q6: Where to export evidence?
**A:** User-defined location (default: Desktop). Contains DB snapshot, logs, state JSON, README, governance checklist.

### Q7: Separate demo/production code?
**A:** No - Demo mode exercises REAL production code paths. Single codebase for confidence.

### Q8: What is soak testing?
**A:** Long-duration testing (24-48 hours) to detect memory leaks, resource exhaustion, performance degradation over time.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Console Orchestration (Not Reimplementation)
**Decision:** Console calls PowerShell scripts via `exec.Command`, doesn't reimplement logic
**Rationale:**
- PowerShell scripts proven (400+ lines each, field-tested)
- Zero reimplementation risk
- Single codebase (scripts work standalone or via Console)
- Fast implementation (6-8 hours vs 20+ hours rewrite)

### 2. Real 2-3GB Files (Not Small Test Files)
**Decision:** Use 2-3GB medical imaging files for all demos
**Rationale:**
- Realistic for clinical environment
- Proves system handles real-world file sizes
- CCSO sees authentic performance
- Total demo time: 25 minutes (5 scenarios × 5 min)

### 3. Triple-Locked Corruption Safety
**Decision:** Three layers of protection for corruption injection
**Rationale:**
- Zero risk tolerance (cannot corrupt production)
- Clear audit trail (all logged)
- Only works in Demo mode with explicit confirmation
- CCSO confident safety measures robust

### 4. Evidence Auto-Collection
**Decision:** One-click evidence export with all components
**Rationale:**
- No manual steps for governance review
- Consistent package format
- CCSO can take package and verify independently
- README has clear verification steps

### 5. Auto-Cleanup Between Scenarios
**Decision:** Automated reset (not manual)
**Rationale:**
- No risk of leftover files contaminating next demo
- Fast transition between scenarios (30s)
- User can opt to keep destination files
- Bulletproof execution (no human error)

2. Create `handlers_demo.go` - Demo page handler
3. Create `demo.html` - Basic UI with pre-flight panel
4. Test pre-flight checks (should block if service stopped)
5. Create `executor.go` - PowerShell execution framework
6. Implement Scenario 1 orchestration
7. Add SSE streaming for real-time progress
8. Test: Click button → PowerShell runs → Progress updates → Complete

**Success Criteria:** Scenario 1 runs from Console UI with real-time progress

**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

### Priority 2: External Poller

**Goal:** Prove non-locking file operations

**Tasks:**
1. Create `poller.go` - Polling implementation
2. Add start/stop API endpoints
3. Add UI panel with statistics

- **281/281 tests** (100% pass rate)
  - Domain: 143 tests
  - Infrastructure: 116 tests
  - Resilience: 22 tests

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ State history API endpoint working
- ✅ Console UI displays state transitions
- ✅ Filter persistence across refreshes
- ✅ Scroll detection prevents refresh interruption

## Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk: CCSO Demo Failure
**Risk:** Live demo crashes during presentation → project over
**Impact:** Critical
**Mitigation:**
- Practice 5+ times before CCSO meeting
- Create backup plan (pre-recorded video, screenshots)
- Have evidence packages from previous successful runs
- Document troubleshooting steps
- Test on presentation machine beforehand

### Medium Risk: PowerShell Parsing Fails
**Risk:** Console can't parse PowerShell output → no progress updates
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Test extensively with all 5 scenarios
- Add fallback: show raw PowerShell output if parsing fails
- Log all parsing errors for debugging

### Low Risk: External Poller Shows Locks
**Risk:** Poller detects locked files → appears system failed
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Thoroughly test non-locking behavior before demo
- If locks detected, investigate root cause (shouldn't happen)
- ForkerDotNet uses FileShare.Read (allows concurrent reads)

---

## Performance Observations

### File Processing Throughput
- **Small files (50MB):** 250ms total (too fast to observe states)
- **Large files (2-3GB):** 8-12s total (visible in Console)
- **Throughput:** ~1GB/min per target (as specified)
- **Memory:** <100MB service usage (streaming operations)

### Concurrent Operations
- **Max concurrency:** 4 files simultaneously (2 per target)
- **Queueing:** Files wait for semaphore slots
- **Example:** 6 files dropped → 3 start immediately, 3 queue → process in batches

### Console Refresh Rates
- **Normal mode:** 2000ms (2 seconds)
- **Demo mode:** 500ms (planned - for real-time feel)
- **Impact:** Minimal on service (read-only queries)

---

## Configuration Changes

### appsettings.Demo.json Updated

**Before:**
```json
"Testing": {
    "VerificationDelaySeconds": 10,  // Artificial delay
    "VerboseTestLogging": true
}
// No StateChangeLogging section
```

**After:**
```json
"Testing": {
    "EnableTestMode": true,
    "VerificationDelaySeconds": 0,  // Removed artificial delay
    "VerboseTestLogging": true
},
"StateChangeLogging": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "MaxRecords": 100000,
    "AutoCleanupEnabled": true,
    "RetentionDays": 90,
    "IncludeAdditionalContext": true
}
```

**Rationale:** State logging makes artificial delay obsolete - we can observe real transitions

## Lessons Learned

### 1. API Field Name Mismatches Are Easy to Miss
**Lesson:** API returns `copyState` but UI expected `state`
**Solution:** Use flexible field access: `target.copyState || target.state || 'Unknown'`
**Prevention:** Generate TypeScript types from API schema (future enhancement)

### 2. Polling Intervals Matter for Demo Visibility
**Lesson:** 2s refresh too slow to see <250ms state transitions
**Solution:** Accelerate to 500ms during demo mode
**Guideline:** Demo refresh should be ≤50% of expected transition time

### 3. Existing PowerShell Infrastructure is Gold
**Lesson:** PowerShell scripts are 400+ lines each, mature, proven
**Solution:** Don't reimplement - orchestrate via Console
**Rule:** Reuse proven code whenever possible (zero reimplementation risk)

### 4. Triple-Lock Safety for Demos
**Lesson:** Corruption injection for demo MUST be impossible in production
**Solution:** Environment + Config + Explicit confirmation
**Principle:** Safety mechanisms should be independent layers (defense in depth)

### 5. Evidence Collection Builds Confidence
**Lesson:** CCSO needs tangible proof (not just live demo)
**Solution:** Auto-export DB snapshot, logs, state history, governance checklist
**Best Practice:** Automated evidence collection with clear verification steps

---

## Outstanding Questions (For Future)

1. **Browser Compatibility:**
   - Does Console UI work in Edge? (Most NHS machines use Edge)
   - Need to test SSE EventSource in Edge

2. **Large File Performance:**
   - 3GB file = ~8-12s processing
   - Is this acceptable for demo timing?
   - Can we process 5 scenarios in 25 minutes?

3. **Network Drive Performance:**
   - Will DestinationA/B be network shares in production?
   - How does this affect timing?
   - Need to test with SMB shares

4. **Scenario 4 (Crash Recovery):**
   - Requires Administrator privileges
   - Can we auto-restart service?
   - Or manual restart with clear instructions?

5. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - Can PowerShell integration test suite run in GitHub Actions?
   - Need Windows runner for PowerShell scripts
   - Consider Linux compatibility (future)
